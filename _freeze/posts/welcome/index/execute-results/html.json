Create a new directory inside the posts folder with your post name\n2. Add an `index.qmd` file inside this directory\n3. Add any related resources (images, data) in the same directory\n4. Write your content using Markdown, code chunks, and LaTeX\n5. Render and preview locally with `quarto preview`\n6. Build the site with `quarto render`\n7. Commit and push changes to `GitHub`\n\n### Text\n\nA comprehensive guide can be found [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).\n\nHere is some simple text. You can\n\n-   *use very differnt styles*: italics, bold, verbatim, super/subscripts, strikethrough, etc.\n-   *Make headings*: using #. Using more \\#'s makes the headings smaller.\n-   Create differnt types of *lists and task checkers*; **NB:** You need a blank line before the list to be rendered as such;\n-   *Use footnotes*: this is possible like this;[^1]\n-   *Use tables*;\n\n[^1]: Here is a footnote.\n\n### Math\n\nYou can do many things with mathematics.\n\n-   *Inline math*: $x = y$.\n-   *Math block*: $$ e^{i \\pi} = 1$$\n\nyada yada\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\boxed{\n\\frac{f(x)}{\\mathbfcal{H}(y)} = \\int_a^b h(z, x, y)dz\n}\n\\end{equation}\n\nYou can also define custom *latex* macros by using *hidden blocks* as follows:\n\n::: hidden\n$$\n \\def\\RR{{\\bf R}}\n \\def\\bold#1{{\\bf #1}}\n \\def\\fr#1#2{{\\frac{#1}{#2}}}\n$$\n:::\n\n$\\RR$ $\\bold x$ $\\fr a b$ $\\mathbf{x}$\n\n#### Theorems and proofs\nTheorems are commonly used in articles and books in mathematics. To include a reference-able theorem, create a div with a `#thm-` label (or one of other theorem-type labels described [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html)). You also need to specify a theorem name either via the first heading in the block. You can include any content you like within the div. For example:\n\n::: {#thm-line}\n\n## Line\n\nThe equation of any straight line, called a linear equation, can be written as:\n\n$$\ny = mx + b\n$$\n:::\n\nSee @thm-line.\n\n::: {#lem-}\n\n## Some lemma\n\nStatement\n:::\n\n:::: {#.proof}\nthe proof\n::::\n\n#### Equations\nProvide an `#eq-` label immediately after an equation to make it referenceable. For example:\n\nBlack-Scholes (@eq-black-scholes) is a mathematical model that seeks to explain the behavior of financial derivatives, most commonly options:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathrm C}{ \\partial \\mathrm t } + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2} \\mathrm S^{2}\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} \\mathrm C}{\\partial \\mathrm S^2}\n  + \\mathrm r \\mathrm S \\frac{\\partial \\mathrm C}{\\partial \\mathrm S}\\ =\n  \\mathrm r \\mathrm C \n$$ {#eq-black-scholes}\n\n::: {#rem-}\nNumbers on equations appear if you include a label (same for theorems, lemas, etc..).\n:::\n\n#### Sections\nTo reference a section, add a `#sec-` identifier to any heading.\n\nNote that when using section cross-references, you will also need to enable the number-sections option (so that section numbering is visible to readers). For example:\n\n```default\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nnumber-sections: true\n---\n```\n\n### Code\n\nAgain, use the *code* shortcut to trigger different options. Hereby we see some:\n\n**Simple code block**\n\n```         \nCode example\n```\n\n**Inline code**\n\n`code example`\n\n**Fenced code block**: here you can specify the programming language:\n\n**Python**\n\n``` python\nx = 3\nfor i in range(x):\n    print(i) \n```\n\n**C#**\n\n``` c#\nvar x = 3\nfor(int i = 0; i < x; i++)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(i)\n}\n```\n\n**Default language**: Pandoc supports syntax highlighting for over 140 different languages. If your language is not supported then you can use the default language to get a similar visual treatment:\n\n``` default\nyada yada\n```\n\n**Executable code block**: Not that many are currently supported but Python is.\n\n::: {#33f54ed1 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nx = 3\nfor i in range(x):\n    print(i, end=' ') \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n0 1 2 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can even run some external program. In this example, let us run `code.py`:\n\n``` {.python filename=\"example.py\"}\nx = 3\nfor i in range(x):\n    print(i, end=' ') \n```\n\nWe can also go to a new page as follows: {{< pagebreak >}}\n\n#### Code Annotation\nCode blocks and executable code cells in Quarto can include line-based annotations. Line-based annotations provide a way to attach explanation to lines of code much like footnotes.\n\nAnnotations for a code cell consist of two related elements:\n\n1. Each annotated line should be terminated with a comment (using the code cell’s language comment character) followed by a space and then an annotation number enclosed in angle brackets (e.g. # <2>). You may repeat an annotation number if the annotation spans multiple lines.\n2. An ordered list that appears immediately after the code cell which includes the contents of each annotation. Each numbered item in the ordered list will correspond to the line(s) of code with the same annotation number.\n\n```python\ndef compute_triangle_area(base, height):\n    assert(isinstance(base, [float, int])), f\"base should be of type float, but got a {type(base)} type\"         # <1>\n    assert(isinstance(height, [float, int])), f\" height should be of type float, but got a {type(height)} type\" # <1>\n    return base * height # <2>\n```\n1. Checks if both `base` and `height` are of type `int` or `float`, throws an error otherwise.\n2. Returns the triangle area: $A = b \\times h$.\n\n### Raw content\n\nRaw content can be included directly without Quarto parsing it using Pandoc’s raw attribute. Here is an example of an HTML block\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe src=\"https://quarto.org/\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\n```\n\nYou can also add *inline* raw content like this: Here's some raw inline HTML: <a>html</a>\n\n### Images\n\nSee [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html).\n\n### Tables\n\nSee [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html)\n\n### Diagrams\n\nQuarto has native support for embedding [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/#/) and [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) diagrams. This enables you to create flowcharts, sequence diagrams, state diagrams, Gantt charts, and more using a plain text syntax inspired by markdown.\n\nFor example, here we embed a flowchart created using Mermaid:\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart LR\n  A[Hard edge] --> B(Round edge)\n  B --> C{Decision}\n  C --> D[Result one]\n  C --> E[Result two]\n```\n\n### Videos\n\nYou can include videos in documents using the as follows {{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/wo9vZccmqwc >}} Videos can refer to video files (e.g. MPEG) or can be links to videos published on YouTube, Vimeo, or Brightcove.\n\n### Divs and spans\n\nYou can add classes, attributes, and other identifiers to regions of content using Divs and Spans. Although the terms Div and Span originate in HTML, the syntax is used in Quarto across output formats. For example, Callout Blocks are specified using the div syntax, and Small Caps are specified using the span syntax, and both work for many formats beyond HTML. You may also use CSS and/or a Filter along with Divs and Spans to provide styling or other behavior within rendered documents beyond what Quarto provides.\n\n##### Divs\n\nFor example, here we add the “border” class to a region of content using a div (`:::`):\n\nDivs start with a fence containing at least three consecutive colons plus some attributes. The attributes may optionally be followed by another string of consecutive colons. The Div ends with another line containing a string of at least three consecutive colons. The Div should be separated by blank lines from preceding and following blocks. Divs may also be nested. For example\n\n:::: {#special .sidebar}\n::: warning\nHere is a warning.\n:::\n\nMore content.\n::::\n\n::: border\nThis content can be styled with a border\n:::\n\n##### Spans\n\nA bracketed sequence of inlines, as one would use to begin a link, will be treated as a Span with attributes if it is followed immediately by attributes:\n\n[This is *some text*]{.class key=\"val\"}\n\nTo create text in small caps, that is underlined, or that is highlighted, use a span with one of the classes .smallcaps, .underline or .mark respectively.\n\n[This text is smallcaps]{.smallcaps}\n\n[This text is underlined]{.underline}\n\n[This text is highlighted]{.mark}\n\n### Callout Blocks\n\nCallouts are an excellent way to draw extra attention to certain concepts, or to more clearly indicate that certain content is supplemental or applicable to only some scenarios.\n\nThere are five different types of callouts available.\n\n-   `note`\n-   `warning`\n-   `important`\n-   `tip`\n-   `caution`\n\n::: callout-note\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including: `note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.\n:::\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Tip with Title\n\nThis is an example of a callout with a title.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Tip with Title\"}\nThis is a callout with a title.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## Expand To Learn About Collapse\\*\\*\n\nThis is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use `collapse=\"true\"` to collapse it by default or `collapse=\"false\"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.\n:::\n\nYou can customize the style of these `callout blocks`.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Pay Attention\n\nUsing callouts is an effective way to highlight content that your reader give special consideration or attention.\n:::\n\nYou can also remove the icon if you want\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Pay Attention\n\nUsing callouts is an effective way to highlight content that your reader give special consideration or attention.\n:::\n\nFinally, you can cross reference blocks using the customary `@`\n\n::: {#tip-example .callout-tip}\n## Cross-Referencing a Tip\n\nAdd an ID starting with `#tip-` to reference a tip.\n:::\n\nSee @tip-example...\n\n| Callout Type | Prefix |\n|--------------|--------|\n|    `note`    | `#nte-`|\n|    `tip`     | `#tip-`|\n|    `warning` | `#wrn-`|\n|  `important` | `#imp-`|\n|  `caution`   | `#cau-`|\n\n: Prefixes for callout cross-references\n\n### Shortcuts\n\nThere are some shortcuts thta make writing in *Quarto* faster;\n\n#### Pre-installed\n\nHere is a list of words that you can type on the keyboard to trigger different functionalities (via *autocompletion*):\n\n-   **list**: to create one ordered (with numbers) or not (with dots);\n-   **code**: to trigger anything code-related;\n-   **italic**: to trigger italic mode;\n-   **bold**: to trigger bold;\n-   **strikethrough**: to trigger something ~~like this~~;\n\n#### Custom-shortcuts\n::: {.callout-important collapse=\"true\"}\n## Custom shortcuts to complete\n\nTo Do!\n:::\n\n### Customization\n\n#### `brand.yml`\nQuarto supports `brand.yml`—a single `YAML` file that can be used to customize the appearance of your documents across multiple formats. This is particularly useful for organizations that need a unified look across various formats.\n\n**An example**\n```default\ncolor:\n  palette:\n    dark-grey: \"#222222\"\n    blue: \"#ddeaf1\"\n  background: blue\n  foreground: dark-grey\n  primary: black\n\nlogo: \n  medium: logo.png\n\ntypography:\n  fonts:\n    - family: Jura\n      source: google\n  base: Jura\n  headings: Jura\n```\n\nThe elements of `brand.yml` are specified in the documentation for the [brand.yml project](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/). In this section, learn how these elements are used in Quarto.\n\n#### Colors\nUse `color` to define your brand’s color palette and map your palette to the roles colors play, a.k.a semantic colors. A simple example might define the value background to a light blue:\n```default\ncolor:\n  background: \"#ddeaf1\"\n```\n\n#### Margin cotent\nYou can place content within the right margin of Quarto document. For example, here we use the `.column-margin` class to place an image in the margin:\n\n$$\ne^{i\\pi} = 1\n$$\n\n::: {.column-margin}\nWe know from *the first fundamental theorem of calculus* that for $x$ in $[a, b]$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}\\left( \\int_{a}^{x} f(u)\\,du\\right)=f(x).$$\n:::\n\nClearly, this can be done with images as well.\n\n#### Margin figures\nFigures that you create using code cells can be placed in the margin by using the column: margin code cell option. If the code produces more than one figure, each of the figures will be placed in the margin.\n\n```default\n#| label: fig-mtcars\n#| fig-cap: \"MPG vs horsepower, colored by transmission.\"\n#| column: margin\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nmtcars2 <- mtcars\nmtcars2$am <- factor(\n  mtcars$am, labels = c('automatic', 'manual')\n)\nggplot(mtcars2, aes(hp, mpg, color = am)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = \"loess\") +\n  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')```\n```\n\n#### Margin refereces\nFootnotes and the bibliography typically appear at the end of the document, but you can choose to have them placed in the margin by setting the following option1 in the document front matter:\n```default\n---\nreference-location: margin\ncitation-location: margin\n---\n```\nWith these options set, footnotes and citations will (respectively) be automatically be placed in the margin of the document rather than the bottom of the page. As an example, when I cite Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund ([2018](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)), the citation bibliography entry itself will now appear in the margin.\n\n#### Asides\nAsides allow you to place content aside from the content it is placed in. Asides look like footnotes, but do not include the footnote mark (the superscript number).\n[This is a span that has the class `aside` which places it in the margin without a footnote number.]{.aside}\n\n#### Margin captions\nFor figures and tables, you may leave the content in the body of the document while placing the caption in the margin of the document. Using cap-location: margin in a code cell or document front matter to control this. For example:\n```default\n#| label: fig-cap-margin\n#| fig-cap: \"MPG vs horsepower, colored by transmission.\"\n#| cap-location: margin\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nmtcars2 <- mtcars\nmtcars2$am <- factor(\n  mtcars$am, labels = c('automatic', 'manual')\n)\nggplot(mtcars2, aes(hp, mpg, color = am)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = \"loess\") +\n  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')\n```\n\n#### Using classes\nIn addition to global and code cell specific options, you may use divs with layout classes (prefixed with `.column-`) to arrange content into columns:\n\n::: {.column-margin}\nThis content will appear in the margin!\n:::\n\n### Tabsets\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n## R\n\n``` {.r}\nfizz_buzz <- function(fbnums = 1:50) {\n  output <- dplyr::case_when(\n    fbnums %% 15 == 0 ~ \"FizzBuzz\",\n    fbnums %% 3 == 0 ~ \"Fizz\",\n    fbnums %% 5 == 0 ~ \"Buzz\",\n    TRUE ~ as.character(fbnums)\n  )\n  print(output)\n}\n```\n\n## Python\n\n``` {.python}\ndef fizz_buzz(num):\n  if num % 15 == 0:\n    print(\"FizzBuzz\")\n  elif num % 5 == 0:\n    print(\"Buzz\")\n  elif num % 3 == 0:\n    print(\"Fizz\")\n  else:\n    print(num)\n```\n\n:::\n\n### Citations\nQuarto will use Pandoc to automatically generate citations and a bibliography in a number of styles. To use this capability, you will need:\n\n1. A quarto document formatted with citations (see [Citation Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/citations.html#sec-citations)).\n2. A bibliographic data source, for example a BibLaTeX (`.bib`) or BibTeX (`.bibtex`) file.\n3. Optionally, a `CSL` file which specifies the formatting to use when generating the citations and bibliography (when not using `natbib` or `biblatex` to generate the bibliography).\n\nIn the front, just add `bibliography: references.bib`.\n\n",
