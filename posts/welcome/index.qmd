# Welcome to My Technical Blog

This is my first post on my new technical blog. I'll be documenting my learning journey and technical experiments here.

## Why Quarto?

Quarto is an excellent choice for technical blogging because it supports:

1. Code execution and visualization
2. Mathematics with LaTeX syntax
3. Cross-references and citations
4. Multiple output formats

## Let's Try Some Code

Here's a simple Python example:

```{python}
# A simple example
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate some data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

# Create a plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
plt.plot(x, y, 'b-', linewidth=2)
plt.title('Sine Wave')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('sin(x)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

## And Some Math

The solution to a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
