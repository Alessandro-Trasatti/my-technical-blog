    "\n",
    "## Typical workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time you want to create a new blog post:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Create a new directory inside the posts folder with your post name\n",
    "2.  Add an `index.qmd` file inside this directory\n",
    "3.  Add any related resources (images, data) in the same directory\n",
    "4.  Write your content using Markdown, code chunks, and LaTeX\n",
    "5.  Render and preview locally with `quarto preview`\n",
    "6.  Build the site with `quarto render`\n",
    "7.  Commit and push changes to `GitHub`\n",
    "\n",
    "## What can you do?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text\n",
    "\n",
    "A comprehensive guide can be found [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is some simple text. You can\n",
    "\n",
    "-   *use very differnt styles*: italics, bold, verbatim, super/subscripts, strikethrough, etc.\n",
    "-   *Make headings*: using #. Using more #’s makes the headings smaller.\n",
    "-   Create differnt types of *lists and task checkers*; **NB:** You need a blank line before the list to be rendered as such;\n",
    "-   *Use footnotes*: this is possible like this;[1]\n",
    "-   *Use tables*;\n",
    "\n",
    "### Math\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do many things with mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   *Inline math*: $x = y$.\n",
    "-   *Math block*: $$ e^{i \\pi} = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "yada yada\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also define custom *latex* macros by using *hidden blocks* as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    " \\def\\RR{{\\bf R}}\n",
    " \\def\\bold#1{{\\bf #1}}\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\RR$ $\\bold x$ $\\fr a b$ $\\mathbf{x}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theorems and proofs\n",
    "\n",
    "Theorems are commonly used in articles and books in mathematics. To include a reference-able theorem, create a div with a `#thm-` label (or one of other theorem-type labels described [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html)). You also need to specify a theorem name either via the first heading in the block. You can include any content you like within the div. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"theorem-title\">**Theorem 1 (Line)**</span> The equation of any straight line, called a linear equation, can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = mx + b\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "See <a href=\"#thm-line\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Theorem 1</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"theorem-title\">**Lemma 1 (Some lemma)**</span> Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "the proof\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide an `#eq-` label immediately after an equation to make it referenceable. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Black-Scholes (<a href=\"#eq-black-scholes\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Equation 1</a>) is a mathematical model that seeks to explain the behavior of financial derivatives, most commonly options:\n",
    "\n",
    "<span id=\"eq-black-scholes\">$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial \\mathrm C}{ \\partial \\mathrm t } + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2} \\mathrm S^{2}\n",

    "  + \\mathrm r \\mathrm S \\frac{\\partial \\mathrm C}{\\partial \\mathrm S}\\ =\n",
    "  \\mathrm r \\mathrm C \n",
    " \\qquad(1)$$</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"proof-title\">*Remark 1*. </span>Numbers on equations appear if you include a label (same for theorems, lemas, etc..).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sections\n",
    "\n",
    "To reference a section, add a `#sec-` identifier to any heading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when using section cross-references, you will also need to enable the number-sections option (so that section numbering is visible to readers). For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` default\n",
    "---\n",
    "title: \"My Document\"\n",
    "number-sections: true\n",

    "Annotations for a code cell consist of two related elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Each annotated line should be terminated with a comment (using the code cell’s language comment character) followed by a space and then an annotation number enclosed in angle brackets (e.g. # \\<2\\>). You may repeat an annotation number if the annotation spans multiple lines.\n",
    "2.  An ordered list that appears immediately after the code cell which includes the contents of each annotation. Each numbered item in the ordered list will correspond to the line(s) of code with the same annotation number.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def compute_triangle_area(base, height):\n",
    "    assert(isinstance(base, [float, int])), f\"base should be of type float, but got a {type(base)} type\"\n",

    "### Divs and spans\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add classes, attributes, and other identifiers to regions of content using Divs and Spans. Although the terms Div and Span originate in HTML, the syntax is used in Quarto across output formats. For example, Callout Blocks are specified using the div syntax, and Small Caps are specified using the span syntax, and both work for many formats beyond HTML. You may also use CSS and/or a Filter along with Divs and Spans to provide styling or other behavior within rendered documents beyond what Quarto provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Divs\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here we add the “border” class to a region of content using a div (`:::`):\n",
    "\n",
    "Divs start with a fence containing at least three consecutive colons plus some attributes. The attributes may optionally be followed by another string of consecutive colons. The Div ends with another line containing a string of at least three consecutive colons. The Div should be separated by blank lines from preceding and following blocks. Divs may also be nested. For example\n",

    "##### Spans\n",
    "\n",
    "A bracketed sequence of inlines, as one would use to begin a link, will be treated as a Span with attributes if it is followed immediately by attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"class\" key=\"val\">This is *some text*</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "To create text in small caps, that is underlined, or that is highlighted, use a span with one of the classes .smallcaps, .underline or .mark respectively.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Colors\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `color` to define your brand’s color palette and map your palette to the roles colors play, a.k.a semantic colors. A simple example might define the value background to a light blue:\n",

    "#### Margin cotent\n",
    "\n",
    "You can place content within the right margin of Quarto document. For example, here we use the `.column-margin` class to place an image in the margin:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Asides\n",
    "\n",
    "Asides allow you to place content aside from the content it is placed in. Asides look like footnotes, but do not include the footnote mark (the superscript number). <span class=\"column-margin margin-aside\">This is a span that has the class `aside` which places it in the margin without a footnote number.</span>\n",

    "2.  A bibliographic data source, for example a BibLaTeX (`.bib`) or BibTeX (`.bibtex`) file.\n",
    "3.  Optionally, a `CSL` file which specifies the formatting to use when generating the citations and bibliography (when not using `natbib` or `biblatex` to generate the bibliography).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the front, just add `bibliography: references.bib`."

    "\n",
    "1. Create a new directory inside the posts folder with your post name\n",
    "2. Add an `index.qmd` file inside this directory\n",
    "3. Add any related resources (images, data) in the same directory\n",
    "4. Write your content using Markdown, code chunks, and LaTeX\n",

    "\n",
    "A comprehensive guide can be found [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is some simple text. You can\n",
    "\n",
    "-   *use very differnt styles*: italics, bold, verbatim, super/subscripts, strikethrough, etc.\n",
    "-   *Make headings*: using #. Using more #'s makes the headings smaller.\n",
    "-   Create differnt types of *lists and task checkers*; **NB:** You need a blank line before the list to be rendered as such;\n",
    "-   *Use footnotes*: this is possible like this;[^1]\n",
    "-   *Use tables*;\n",
    "\n",
    "### Math\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do many things with mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   *Inline math*: $x = y$.\n",
    "-   *Math block*: $$ e^{i \\pi} = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "yada yada\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also define custom *latex* macros by using *hidden blocks* as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    " \\def\\RR{{\\bf R}}\n",
    " \\def\\bold#1{{\\bf #1}}\n",

    "$\\RR$ $\\bold x$ $\\fr a b$ $\\mathbf{x}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theorems and proofs\n",
    "\n",
    "Theorems are commonly used in articles and books in mathematics. To include a reference-able theorem, create a div with a `#thm-` label (or one of other theorem-type labels described [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html)). You also need to specify a theorem name either via the first heading in the block. You can include any content you like within the div. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"theorem-title\">**Theorem 1 (Line)**</span> The equation of any straight line, called a linear equation, can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = mx + b\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "See <a href=\"#thm-line\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Theorem 1</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"theorem-title\">**Lemma 1 (Some lemma)**</span> Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "the proof\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide an `#eq-` label immediately after an equation to make it referenceable. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Black-Scholes (<a href=\"#eq-black-scholes\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Equation 1</a>) is a mathematical model that seeks to explain the behavior of financial derivatives, most commonly options:\n",
    "\n",
    "<span id=\"eq-black-scholes\">$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial \\mathrm C}{ \\partial \\mathrm t } + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2} \\mathrm S^{2}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial^{2} \\mathrm C}{\\partial \\mathrm S^2}\n",
    "  + \\mathrm r \\mathrm S \\frac{\\partial \\mathrm C}{\\partial \\mathrm S}\\ =\n",
    "  \\mathrm r \\mathrm C \n",
    " \\qquad(1)$$</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"proof-title\">*Remark 1*. </span>Numbers on equations appear if you include a label (same for theorems, lemas, etc..).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sections\n",
    "\n",
    "To reference a section, add a `#sec-` identifier to any heading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when using section cross-references, you will also need to enable the number-sections option (so that section numbering is visible to readers). For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` default\n",
    "---\n",
    "title: \"My Document\"\n",
    "number-sections: true\n",

    "**Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "x = 3\n",
    "for i in range(x):\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also go to a new page as follows: \u000c\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Annotation\n",
    "\n",
    "Code blocks and executable code cells in Quarto can include line-based annotations. Line-based annotations provide a way to attach explanation to lines of code much like footnotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Annotations for a code cell consist of two related elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Each annotated line should be terminated with a comment (using the code cell's language comment character) followed by a space and then an annotation number enclosed in angle brackets (e.g. # \\<2\\>). You may repeat an annotation number if the annotation spans multiple lines.\n",
    "2.  An ordered list that appears immediately after the code cell which includes the contents of each annotation. Each numbered item in the ordered list will correspond to the line(s) of code with the same annotation number.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def compute_triangle_area(base, height):\n",
    "    assert(isinstance(base, [float, int])), f\"base should be of type float, but got a {type(base)} type\"\n",
    "    assert(isinstance(height, [float, int])), f\" height should be of type float, but got a {type(height)} type\"\n",
    "    return base * height\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lines 2-3\n",
    ":   Checks if both `base` and `height` are of type `int` or `float`, throws an error otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Line 4\n",
    ":   Returns the triangle area: $A = b \\times h$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Raw content\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw content can be included directly without Quarto parsing it using Pandoc's raw attribute. Here is an example of an HTML block\n",
    "\n",
    "<iframe src=\"https://quarto.org/\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also add *inline* raw content like this: Here's some raw inline HTML: <a>html</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Images\n",
    "\n",
    "See [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "See [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "Quarto has native support for embedding [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/#/) and [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) diagrams. This enables you to create flowcharts, sequence diagrams, state diagrams, Gantt charts, and more using a plain text syntax inspired by markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here we embed a flowchart created using Mermaid:\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure class=''>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre class=\"mermaid mermaid-js\">flowchart LR\n",
    "  A[Hard edge] --&gt; B(Round edge)\n",
    "  B --&gt; C{Decision}\n",
    "  C --&gt; D[Result one]\n",
    "  C --&gt; E[Result two]\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Videos\n",
    "\n",
    "You can include videos in documents using the as follows <https://www.youtube.com/embed/wo9vZccmqwc> Videos can refer to video files (e.g. MPEG) or can be links to videos published on YouTube, Vimeo, or Brightcove.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Divs and spans\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add classes, attributes, and other identifiers to regions of content using Divs and Spans. Although the terms Div and Span originate in HTML, the syntax is used in Quarto across output formats. For example, Callout Blocks are specified using the div syntax, and Small Caps are specified using the span syntax, and both work for many formats beyond HTML. You may also use CSS and/or a Filter along with Divs and Spans to provide styling or other behavior within rendered documents beyond what Quarto provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Divs\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here we add the \"border\" class to a region of content using a div (`:::`):\n",
    "\n",
    "Divs start with a fence containing at least three consecutive colons plus some attributes. The attributes may optionally be followed by another string of consecutive colons. The Div ends with another line containing a string of at least three consecutive colons. The Div should be separated by blank lines from preceding and following blocks. Divs may also be nested. For example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a warning.\n",
    "\n",
    "More content.\n",
    "\n",
    "This content can be styled with a border\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Spans\n",
    "\n",
    "A bracketed sequence of inlines, as one would use to begin a link, will be treated as a Span with attributes if it is followed immediately by attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"class\" key=\"val\">This is *some text*</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "To create text in small caps, that is underlined, or that is highlighted, use a span with one of the classes .smallcaps, .underline or .mark respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"smallcaps\">This text is smallcaps</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>This text is underlined</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"mark\">This text is highlighted</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Callout Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "Callouts are an excellent way to draw extra attention to certain concepts, or to more clearly indicate that certain content is supplemental or applicable to only some scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five different types of callouts available.\n",

    "#### `brand.yml`\n",
    "\n",
    "Quarto supports `brand.yml`---a single `YAML` file that can be used to customize the appearance of your documents across multiple formats. This is particularly useful for organizations that need a unified look across various formats.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Colors\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `color` to define your brand's color palette and map your palette to the roles colors play, a.k.a semantic colors. A simple example might define the value background to a light blue:\n",
